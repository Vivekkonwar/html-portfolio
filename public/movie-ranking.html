<h1>The Best Movies according to Vivek</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h2>Spirited Away</h2>

<p>1)As with every Miyazaki picture, Spirited Away wants to at once amaze and familiarize you with an impossible dream, but it remains unique within his oeuvre for cementing that narrative desire into the essential groundwork of the story. </P>
<P>2)Spirited Away is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.</P>

<h2>Ex Machina</h2>
   
<p> 1)Ex Machina leans heavier on ideas than effects, but it's still a visually polished piece of work -- and an uncommonly engaging sci-fi feature. </P>
<p> 2)Ex Machina is a smart, literate and occasionally quite brilliant film, which will upend a few of your expectations for where this story will end and how it will get there.</p>

<h2>The Interstellar</h2>

<p> 1)Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp. </p>
<p>2)"Interstellar" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science and sentiment, and brains and emotion.</p>
